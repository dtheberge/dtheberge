### Typical Questions
<details closed>
  <summary>What are your strengths?</summary><br/>
  I am extremely determined and driven to learn. I believe learning is strength and freedom in a way, not to sound cheesy. If I have a problem to solve, then I am right there searching for the answer. Additionally, I believe that I am very patient and am empathetic to others' circumstances. <br/><br/>A simple example would be that if a stranger is rude, in general or in retail, I am not one to take it personally, I don't know their life or how their day has gone. Another could be if someone is speeding, they could be heading to the hospital for all we know.</details>
  
<details closed>
  <summary>What are your weaknesses?</summary><br/>
  I am quite self-critical and unwilling to speak on details that I am not knowledgeable. Although the latter may be positive, I believe sometimes that helps create small talk and bonds through conversation. Being self-critical also is accompanied by being a perfectionist, if things aren't perfect it bugs me, but I come to terms that if I don't move on for a long period, my growth can be harmed in the process. ( Not to say being a perfectionist doesn't have its benefits ) Last I would mention here, I have a tendency to take on too much, to where I become overly stressed and worried, however I have made strides in the past year to hault this trend of mine.</details>

<details closed>
  <summary>Could you explain your background briefly?</summary><br/>
 I am from Oklahoma, but moved to Florida late high school. I finished HS in Tampa, FL and then completed a BS in computer science and a BA in pure mathematics at the University of South Florida. I am currently pursuing a MS in computer science at Georgia Tech. 
  <br/><br/>
During undergrad I participated in many activities such as a research opportunity concerning Quantum Algorithms, a study abroad in South Korea, and several computer science projects. A particular project I am proud of was called GoTask. During this I was in a group that had regular meetings with a company, OnTask, to create a Google Chrome extension to integrate OnTask functionality into Chrome, so that users don't have to navigate to their website to make use of their product. I especially enjoyed this as we worked with them in an Agile schedule.
</details>

<details closed>
  <summary>Do I work better independently or in a team?</summary><br/>
I believe two is always better than one. However, I also believe there is a balance. You can't be getting productive work done if you are constantly talking and discussing, nor is doing a project by yourself the quickest. Thus, for myself, I really enjoy working as part of a team and making sure to communicate as best as I can, but also with the drive to learn and work on my own as well.
